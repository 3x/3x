### Hello!
I'm bdn.

I love:
- static web development
- CSS
- free/libre open source software
- making lists

After a mental health break from coding, I've returned and am working on rewriting [new.css](https://github.com/xz/new.css) and getting re-involved in the community. ^â€¿^

Feel free to email me - `me@bdn.sh`
